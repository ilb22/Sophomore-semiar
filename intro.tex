%To make a new section, use the command \section{Title of Section Goes Here}. Use * to suppress numbering. Compare below

\section{Section with Numbering}

\section*{Section without Numbering}

%Use the ``soln'' style to write your problem solutions. Your solution must begin ``\begin{soln}'' and end ``\end{soln}''.
\begin{soln}
	Solution with automatic numbering.
\end{soln}

%Use the ``soln*'' if you want to suppress numbering
\begin{soln*}
	Solution with no numbering.
\end{soln*}

%Use the ``soln*'' along with [] if you want to insert a particular number
\begin{soln*}[3.2.13]
	Solution with custom numbering.
\end{soln*}


%Use the ``align'' to left-align a string of equations with respect to a point of reference.

\section*{Align}
Use the align environment for strings of equations. The \& symbol indicates where you want to align your text. The default mode for align is math so no dollar signs are needed. For some reason, \textbf{your code will not compile if there are any are blank lines (carriage returns) anywhere within the beginning and end of an align environment}. The end of each line should end with \textbackslash \textbackslash.

%The ``align'' environment (vs ``align*'') will number each line individually. Take the asterisk out (in BOTH the beginning and the end) to see how it changes the compiled text.

\begin{align*} 
(x + y)(x - y) &= x(x - y) + y(x - y)\\
 &= x^2 -xy + yx - y^2 \\
 &=x^2 + y^2
\end{align*}

%Feel free to use color for your solutions, but please pick a color that is readable on a computer screen (avoid light/pastel colors)

{\color{red}
\textbf{Instructions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Complete the problems below in \TeX, writing each solution after its corresponding problem statement in the ``soln'' environment OR all solutions in a separate section at the end of this document. 
		\item Use ``Align'' when you are writing a string of more than one equality. 
		\item Write your solutions in the text and math environments respectively, when appropriate. Points will be deducted if text and math type is not properly formatted. See the code for the problem statements as an example.
		\item The introductory text (from this line and above - in the code, from the \} below up to the \textbackslash maketitle command) should be deleted from your final document so that it begins with the problem section.
